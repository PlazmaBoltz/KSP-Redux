--- HOW TO INSTALL ---
1. Download the .zip file
2. Unzip it
3. Put it in your KSA directory under your Content folder
4. Find your manifest.toml file (also in the content folder)
5. Insert the following into the manifest.toml file

[[mods]]
id = "KSP-Redux"
enabled = true

there can be no spaces or line breaks between any parts of the manifest.toml. This means your manifest should look like this:

[[mods]]
id = "Core"
enabled = true
[[mods]]
id = "KSP-Redux"
enabled = true


Change Log:
- Removed Unused texture assets
- Organized some planet textures

--- WANT TO CONTRIBUTE? ---
That's great! Just ping me on the KSA discord (@PlazmaBoltz) in the modding channel. I really want this to be more of a community project instead of just me and 1 other dev.



When will the receive updates?
- It will receive updates whenever something significant is added or bug fixes are made

Known Issues:
- Eve and Laythe have no clouds
- Sometimes planets will appear with only half of their texture



If the game crashes, reloading usually fixes it



Please leave feedback!
